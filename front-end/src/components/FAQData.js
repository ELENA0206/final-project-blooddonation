      question: 'What to Do Before, During and After Your Donation',
      answer: 'von Ebrennac  compares France and Germanys relationship to the fairytale The Beauty and the Beast. This comparison has so many meanings and suggestions. Firstly Vercors is suggesting that the union between the two countries exists only in myth and legend. The  ‘polite invasion’ of the early years of German occupation was an illusion to disguise its true tyrannical nature. This fairytale comparison also reveals that Von Ebrennac, without knowing it, recognizes Nazi values. France is of course the Beauty and Germany the Beast, but the soldier changes the emotional dynamic of the story by focusing on the torment of the beast rather than the capture of the Beauty, creating a positive representation of the Beast. Like Nazi propaganda, the true events are glossed over and undermined. When Ebernnac continues on and says that the their Union, the Beauty and the Beast, is supposed to give rise to “leurs enfants, qui additionnent et mêlent les dons de leurs parents, sont les plus beaux que la terre ait portes.”’ he is indirectly referring to the Nazi aspiration to create a master race, of Aryan people to improve their breeding stock. Finally the act of translating a traditional French story to German is symbolic of translating French culture, society, and politics into German'
